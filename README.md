# PyTicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe in Python

## Setup

Create a virtual environment, if you name it venv-pytictactoe in the top-level directory of this project, Git will ignore it. You can do that like so: python3 -m venv venv-pytictactoe.

Source your virtual environment, like this: source venv-pytictactoe/bin/activate, then run pip install -r venv_requirements.txt to pull down all of the dependencies.

## Running

After sourcing the environment as per the setup instructions you can simply run it like so:

```python3 tictactoe.py```
